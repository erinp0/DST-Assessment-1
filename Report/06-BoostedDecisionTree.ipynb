    "# Boosted Decision Tree Model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains the code and explanation of how the boosted decision tree model was produced. A boosted decision tree is a sum of individual decision trees, trained sequentially on the residuals of the previous stage of the model. In other words, each additional tree focuses on what the previous stage did not predict well.\n",
    "\n",
    "When researching boosted decision trees and how to implement them, I saw that they can sometimes deal with missing values. I therefore decided to look at how they would perform on the original dataset with no data removed or imputed. Of course, when thinking more about how to compare the models produced, it causes issues to have one model run on the original dataset and the others on the imputed version, as it would not be possible to tell whether the results come from the imputation procedure or the models themselves. Thus, I have produced two models at the end, one trained on the original dataset and the other trained on the imputed dataset, and we will analyse the results of both. Both models use the hyperparameters tuned by the original dataset. With the time restraints and the large computation time required to tune hyperparameters, we could not tune both.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common boosted decision tree implementation is known as the Gradient Boosting Machine; however, when looking into this method, I found that the library for it in Python does not automatically handle missing data. A newer method, XGBoost, does, and it has produced better results in many Kaggle competitions. Therefore, I chose to implement the boosted decision tree with XGBoost.\n",

    "## Initial Model and Hyperparameter Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "We now move on to creating the first model. To make the first instance of the model, we define an XGBClassifier. We specify the type of problem we are considering with 'objective', and I chose the evaluation metric, 'eval_metric', to be the log loss. This oversees how the splits in the trees are chosen; they look to minimise the log loss. This metric penalises prediction probabilities that are large distances from the correct output. I chose this for this application as it would be preferrable for more predictions to be close, and give some indication towards heart disease risk than only a few be exact.  Then initial values are set for the hyperparameters of the model, ideas for which were taken from ['Complete Guide to Parameter Tuning in XGBoost'](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/03/complete-guide-parameter-tuning-xgboost-with-codes-python/#h2_9), as well as some previous experimenting with how long a boosted decision tree model takes to run on this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explain what the hyperparameters mean. 'max_depth' specifies the greatest depth each individual tree can take. A model with lots of features may require a larger value for this to encode the complexity, but large values may also cause overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "'min_child_weight' controls the minimum sample that, when building each tree, the algorithm will continue to try to split in two. So a larger value means that less specific regions will be produced, which might help to combat overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "'gamma' controls splits when building each decision tree as it specifies a threshold on the reduction of the loss function that must be exeeded for a split to be made. So a value of 0 will accept all splits that give an improvement, whereas a larger value will stop splitting sooner.\n",
    "\n",
    "'subsample' and 'colsample_bytree' control bagging within the construction of the trees. At each split, we can choose to consider only a subsample of the features ('colsample_bytree') or observations ('subsample'), in a similar way to random forests. Using smaller values for these can reduce overfitting. They are specified by a proportion of the total, i.e. 0.8 keeps 80%.\n",
    "\n",
    "'learning_rate' controls how much may be 'learnt' by each individual tree. It is a proportion and it effectively shrinks the weight of each tree in the end model. Thus a smaller value means that more trees will be needed in total. A smaller value prevents overfitting, but computation time must be balanced. 0.5 is a large learning rate, and I have chosen this because the dataset is large and so a smaller learning rate will take too long. We will reduce it in the final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "'n_estimators' is the number of trees in the model. Given the other hyperparameters, it may be the case that we specify this but due to the other restraints to prevent overfitting, the trees added after a certain point add no new knowledge to the model. Therefore, we will begin by using cross-validation to choose a good value for this hyperparameter - 2000 is chosen as a too-large starting point."

It makes use of early stopping to end the process when no improvement in the metric is found after a specified number of trees added, given by 'early_stopping_rounds'. Here I have chosen to have 'verbose_eval=True', as the process can take a while so this way we can see how it is progressing. I decided on early_stopping_rounds=10 for this metric after looking at the output and seeing that it behaved stably. Sometimes a value such as 50 may be used if the outputs have more fluctuation. Again we use the log loss metric."

    "Looking at the accuracy, this is considerably higher than the original data, even though the hyperparameters were not tuned on this model. It may indicate that the imputation helps the boosted decision tree model a lot more than having missing values. Our analysis of the impuatation did show that is provided better results than randomly assigning 0.5 in the binary features. Although XGBoost is supposed to learn about which way to categorise missing values, it may be that this method is just not as good as the imputation method we chose. We will go on to analyse the outputs more formally, but unfortunately it seems that the hyperparameter tuning may be worthless as the other model will probably give better results."
