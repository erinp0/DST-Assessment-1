    "The aim of this project is to build different supervised learning models for the purpose of binary classification with a dataset of our choice. Afterwards, proceeding to compare the different models with a performance metric. The methods we decided to work with are Logisitic Regression with PCA, K Nearest Neighbour, boosted decision trees and a baseline model.\n",

    "We chose to look into heart disease and the data collected when deciding whether or not someone is potentially at risk. Heart disease is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in the UK and on average 460 people die each day in the UK from a heart or circulatory disease. Healthcare costs relating to heart and circulatory diseases are estimated at £9 billion each year. Due to it's seriousness and the number of lives impacted by it annually we felt this would be an interesting topic to investigate. The ability to detect early signs of heart disease can be the difference between life and death. For more information about heart disease, please visit https://www.bhf.org.uk/-/media/files/research/heart-statistics/bhf-cvd-statistics---uk-factsheet.pdf.\n",

    "We found an appropriate <a href=\"{https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexteboul/heart-disease-health-indicators-dataset-notebook/data}\">{heart disease dataset}</a> that covered the main three criteria we were looking for. The first was that the target variable, whether or not someone is at risk of heart disease or an attack, was binary. The second was that there needed to be a minimum number of observations, which in this case was 441,456. Then the last one was to make sure there were enough relevant features to give us the ability to make accurate and reliable predictions. As this is an American dataset, the results may vary compared to the United Kingdom.

High Cholesterol is 1 if you have it and 0 if not or you haven't checked in the past 5 years. For smoking, 1 if a person has smoked more than 100 cigarettes and 0 otherwise. For strokes, high blood pressure and physical activity are all in binary. Whether or not you eat fruit daily is binary, same as with vegetables. Diabetes is 0 for no, 1 for pre-diabetes or borederline and 2 is for yes. Access to a health plan and medical costs (if any) are binary. General health is on a 1 to 5 scale, 1 being excellent and 5 being poor. Bad mental health days and physical health are out of 30. Difficulty walking is binary and so is sex. Age is 1 if the case is between 18-24 up to 13 where the case is older than 80. This is in 5 year incements. Education is rated 1 to 6 where 1 is never went to school or only went to nursery and 6 being college for 4 years or more.
