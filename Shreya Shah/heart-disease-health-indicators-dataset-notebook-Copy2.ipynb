    "### Selected Subset of Features from BRFSS 2015\n",
    "Given these risk factors, I tried to select features (columns/questions) in the BRFSS related to these risk factors. To help understand what the columns mean, I consult the BRFSS 2015 Codebook to see the questions and information about the questions. I try to match the variable names in the codebook to the variable names in the dataset I downloaded from Kaggle. I also reference some of the same features chosen for a research paper by Zidian Xie et al for *Building Risk Prediction Models for Type 2 Diabetes Using Machine Learning Techniques* using the 2014 BRFSS. Diabetes and Heart Disease outcomes are strongly correlated, with the primary cause of death for diabetics being heart disease complications. Given this information, it is a useful starting point.\n",
